# rtblog
My homework blog - I used all the tools required and did all requirements and even the bonus round. My simple blog allows you to see all post, view single post, edit and delete the post from the main page or while on single view, i also added extra features like using validation on my forms and filters on my main page.

Requirement: As a user, I want to visit a website where I can already see written posts, write new posts, delete posts.<br>
Tools: UI-router, JSON server, bootstrap, angular<br>
Bonus: create a state for viewing single post, let user edit post
